## Acknowledgements

In building Cicada, I have translated and adopted functionality from other open-source projects.
I would kindly thank:

- Vincent T. van Hees and colleagues for their pioneering work on GGIR, an R-package to process actigraphy data. [Visit the GGIR CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html).
- Maxim Osipov, Bart Te Lindert, and German GÃ³mez-Herrero for their work on the [Actant Activity Analysis Toolbox](https://github.com/btlindert/actant-1) and GeneActiv .bin file import functions.
- Yorgi Mavros, and Hyatt Moore, for sharing their code on importing GT3X accelerometry data.

Have a nice day.

Rick
